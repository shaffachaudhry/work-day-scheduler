# work-day-scheduler
Module 05 Third-Party APIs

## Information
User Story of this project: 
To create a webpage that lets someone with a busy schedule add important events to a daily planner during business hours.

## Description
This webpage allows users to add events to a planner with hourly time blocks during normal business hours. The time blocks will change colors to refelct the time of day. The current time block will be highlighted orange. To add an event/task, simply click onto the empty row in the time block and type in a description of the task/event. The user must then click the save button present to the right at which point the webpage will save it. The information will remain on the page even with a reload. To delete, the user may manually delete the description in the block or simply save another instead.
